The Rowan Amateur Radio Society (RARS) operates a repeater system under the call sign N4UH that serves as a vital communication hub for amateur radio operators across Rowan County and surrounding areas. More than just a technical asset, the RARS repeater is a community resource that supports daily radio activity, emergency readiness, and public service communication.

## N4UH Repeater Frequencies

| Band | Frequency | Offset | PL Tone |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **2 Meter** | 145.410 MHz | -0.600 MHz | 136.5 Hz |
| **70 Centimeter** | 443.250 MHz | +5.000 MHz | 136.5 Hz |

## Extending Communication Across the Region

A repeater receives a signal on one frequency and retransmits it on another, dramatically increasing the range of handheld and mobile radios. For local hams, the RARS repeater provides:

- Reliable county wide coverage across Rowan County
- A central meeting point for nets and on air activities
- A dependable link during severe weather or emergencies

Its consistent performance makes it a trusted part of the local amateur radio landscape.

## Maintained by Dedicated Volunteers

The repeater is installed, maintained, and upgraded by RARS volunteers who ensure:

- Compliance with FCC regulations
- High quality audio and signal performance
- Regular testing and preventive maintenance
- Availability for emergency communications when needed

This behind the scenes work keeps the system running smoothly year round.

## A Resource for Public Service

Beyond hobby use, the RARS repeater supports:

- Severe weather nets
- Community event coordination
- Emergency communication when traditional systems fail

Its role in resilience and preparedness makes it an important asset for both amateur operators and the broader community.
