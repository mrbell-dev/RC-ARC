## Silent Keys

In amateur radio, we honor those who have passed on as "Silent Keys" -- a reference to the Morse code key that has gone quiet. These operators dedicated themselves to the hobby, to public service, and to the fellowship of amateur radio.

The Rowan Amateur Radio Society remembers and honors our members who have become Silent Keys. Their contributions to our club and to the amateur radio community will not be forgotten.

> "The CQ has gone unanswered, the frequency silent. But the signals they sent continue to echo in the lives they touched."
