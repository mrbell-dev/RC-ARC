The Rowan Amateur Radio Society (RARS) is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This policy explains how information is collected and used when you visit the RARS website at www.rowanars.net. By using this website, you consent to the practices described below.

## Information Collected Automatically

When you visit the RARS website, limited technical information may be collected automatically, such as the date and time of your visit, your IP address, and the type of web browser used. This information is anonymous and is not personally identifiable. It is used solely to help us understand how the website is used -- for example, which pages are visited most often and how long visitors remain on the site. This data is reviewed only in aggregate and not at the individual level.

## Information You Voluntarily Provide

If you choose to provide personal information to RARS -- for example, by submitting a web form or sending an email -- we use that information only to respond to your inquiry, process your request, or provide the information you asked for.

RARS does not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties. Information may only be disclosed if required to comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal obligations.

## Use of Cookies

RARS may use cookies to analyze general website usage, such as identifying frequently visited pages. Cookies used on this site do not store personal information unless you voluntarily provide it. A cookie can only be read by the website that created it.

If you prefer not to accept cookies, you may configure your web browser to reject them. Doing so will not affect your ability to use the RARS website.
