## RARS ARES

### Communications and Disaster Preparedness

When emergencies strike Rowan County, reliable communication becomes essential. The Rowan Amateur Radio Society (RARS) ARES team plays a critical role in ensuring that emergency managers, public safety agencies, and community partners have dependable backup communication when traditional systems fail or become overloaded.

> "We hope we're never needed -- but we train like we will be."

### ARES in Rowan County: A Mission of Service

RARS ARES volunteers are FCC licensed amateur radio operators trained to provide supplemental communication during disasters, severe weather, and major public events. Their work supports Rowan County Emergency Management and the broader Salisbury region.

### Training for Real World Emergencies

RARS ARES members participate in:

- Weekly and monthly emergency nets
- Portable field exercises simulating grid down operation
- Digital communications training (Winlink, FLDIGI, NBEMS)
- ICS 100/200/700 coursework to integrate with county emergency operations
- Repeater testing and maintenance on the N4UH 145.410 MHz and 443.250 MHz repeaters in Salisbury

These activities ensure operators can deploy quickly and communicate effectively under pressure.

### Ready When Infrastructure Fails

RARS ARES volunteers maintain:

- Solar powered and battery powered stations
- Mobile go kits for rapid deployment
- Portable antennas capable of covering the entire county
- VHF/UHF and HF capabilities for both local and regional communication

This independence from commercial infrastructure makes amateur radio a resilient tool during disasters.

### Supporting Rowan County Agencies

RARS ARES works closely with:

- Rowan County Emergency Management
- Salisbury public safety
- Local fire and EMS departments
- Hospitals and public health partners
- Volunteer organizations such as CERT and the Red Cross

These partnerships ensure amateur radio is fully integrated into the county's emergency response framework.

### Looking Ahead

As Rowan County continues to grow and face new challenges, the role of amateur radio remains vital. RARS ARES is committed to expanding its capabilities, strengthening partnerships, and preparing for the next emergency -- whatever form it takes.
