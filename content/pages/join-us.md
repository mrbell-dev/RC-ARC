Thinking about getting into amateur radio? Already licensed and looking for a local crew? The Rowan Amateur Radio Society (RARS) is a great place to plug in. We're a relaxed, friendly group that enjoys learning, experimenting, and helping each other out -- on the air and in person.

## Why Join RARS

You'll Find a Community. Ham radio is more fun with people around you. At RARS, you'll meet operators of all experience levels who are happy to share ideas, answer questions, and swap stories.

### You'll Get Real Support

New to the hobby? We offer license classes, upgrade help, and VE testing. Already licensed? We've got folks who can help you with antennas, HF setups, digital modes, contesting -- you name it.

### You'll Stay Active

Between monthly meetings, repeater activity, nets, special events, and Field Day, there's always something going on. You can participate as much or as little as you like.

### You'll Be Part of Something Bigger

RARS supports local emergency communication efforts and stays connected to the wider amateur radio community through ARRL affiliation, hamfests, and regional events.

## What Joining Looks Like

It's simple:

- Come to a meeting -- 2nd Monday, [7 PM, Rowan County Rescue Squad, 1140 Julian Rd, Salisbury](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rowan+County+Rescue+Squad+1140+Julian+Rd+Salisbury+NC+28146).
- Say hello -- we'll introduce you around.
- Fill out a short membership form if you want to join.

No pressure. No hoops to jump through. Just a group of radio-minded folks who enjoy welcoming new faces.

## Still Deciding?

Drop by a meeting, listen in on the repeater (145.410 MHz, 136.5 tone), or reach out via email. Get a feel for the club. Most people who visit once end up sticking around.
