New to Discord? This quick start guide covers everything you need to know to get up and running. Discord is a free communication platform used by many amateur radio communities for text, voice, and video chat.

## What is Discord?

Discord is a communication platform that lets you interact through text, voice, and video. It works on desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android), and in your web browser at [discord.com](https://discord.com). Think of it as a mix between group chat and a forum, but in real time.

## Creating an Account

1. Go to [discord.com](https://discord.com) or download the app from your device's app store
2. Click **Register**
3. Enter your email, a username, and a password
4. Verify your email address
5. You're in!

**Tip:** Use your call sign as your display name (e.g., "David - N7WOY") so other hams can recognize you.

## Key Concepts

### Servers

A server is a private, invite-only space for a community. Think of it like a clubhouse with different rooms for different topics. You can be a member of many servers at once. They appear as round icons on the far-left sidebar.

### Text Channels

- Marked with a **#** symbol
- Separate chat rooms for different topics (general chat, announcements, tech help, etc.)
- Type your message in the chat bar at the bottom and press **Enter** to send
- Messages stay in the channel history so you can scroll back and catch up
- You can attach images, files, and links using the **+** button or by dragging and dropping

### Voice Channels

- Marked with a **speaker** icon
- Just click a voice channel name to join -- no calling or ringing needed
- Others can see you're in the channel and drop in anytime
- Supports voice, video, and screen sharing
- Click **Disconnect** (the phone icon) to leave

**Think of it like a repeater:** you join a voice channel and everyone there can hear you. Unlike a repeater, multiple people can talk at once and you can share your screen too!

## Navigating Discord

| Area | Location | What It Does |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Server List** | Far left | Round icons for each server you've joined |
| **Channel List** | Left panel | All channels in the current server |
| **Messages** | Center | Where conversations happen |
| **Member List** | Right panel | Shows who's online |
| **Your Controls** | Bottom left | Your profile, mic, and speaker controls |

## Sending Messages

- Type in the chat bar at the bottom of a text channel and press **Enter**
- **@mention** someone by typing **@** followed by their name to notify them
- **Reply** to a specific message by hovering over it and clicking the reply arrow
- **React** to any message by hovering over it and clicking the smiley face
- Upload files with the **+** button or drag and drop directly into the chat
- Messages can be up to 2,000 characters

## Voice Chat Controls

When you join a voice channel, your controls appear at the bottom left:

- **Microphone icon** -- Mute/unmute yourself
- **Headphone icon** -- Deafen (mute all incoming audio)
- **Camera icon** -- Turn video on/off
- **Screen icon** -- Share your screen or a specific window
- **Phone icon** -- Disconnect from voice

## Direct Messages (DMs)

- Click on someone's name, then **Message** to start a private conversation
- DMs appear under the Discord logo / Home button at the top of your sidebar
- You can create group DMs with up to 10 people
- Voice and video calls work in DMs too

## Managing Notifications

Discord can get noisy. Here's how to keep it manageable:

- **Right-click a server icon** and choose notification settings: All Messages, Only @mentions, or Nothing
- **Right-click a channel** to mute it individually
- **Recommended:** Set servers to "Only @mentions" to avoid notification overload
- Set your status to **Do Not Disturb** to silence all notifications temporarily
- **Mark as Read:** Right-click a server icon to clear all unread indicators

## Status Indicators

- **Green** -- Online
- **Yellow** -- Idle / Away
- **Red** -- Do Not Disturb
- **Gray** -- Offline or Invisible

Set your status by clicking your avatar in the bottom-left corner.

## Text Formatting

Discord supports markdown formatting in messages:

| Format | How to Type It | Result |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Bold | \*\*text\*\* | **text** |
| Italic | \*text\* | *text* |
| Underline | \_\_text\_\_ | __text__ |
| Strikethrough | \~\~text\~\~ | ~~text~~ |
| Inline Code | \`code\` | `code` |
| Quote | \> text | (indented quote) |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ctrl + K** | Quick channel/DM switcher |
| **Ctrl + F** | Search current channel |
| **Ctrl + Shift + M** | Mute/unmute microphone |
| **Ctrl + Shift + D** | Deafen/undeafen audio |
| **Ctrl + E** | Open emoji picker |
| **Ctrl + /** | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| **Esc** | Mark channel as read |
| **Up Arrow** | Edit your last message |

*On Mac, replace Ctrl with Cmd.*

## Roles

Roles are labels assigned to members by server administrators. They control what you can see and do in a server. Role names often appear as colored usernames. Some channels may only be visible to members with certain roles.

## Good Discord Etiquette

- Post in the right channel for the topic
- Use **@everyone** and **@here** sparingly
- Be respectful -- same as on the air
- Read pinned messages when you join a new channel for rules and important info
- Mute your mic in voice channels when you're not talking
- Use threads for long side conversations to keep channels clean
