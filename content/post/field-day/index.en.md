## RARS 2025 Field Day

### Celebrating the Power and Possibility of Ham Radio

The RARS 2025 Annual Field Day brought together radio amateurs, hobbyists, students, and curious newcomers for a full weekend dedicated to the art and science of communication. What began as a technical exercise quickly transformed into a vibrant celebration of teamwork, innovation, and the enduring magic of radio waves.

## A Gathering Built Around Connection

Field Day has always been about more than equipment and antennas. In 2025, the RARS community emphasized the deeper purpose of amateur radio: connecting people. Operators of all ages -- from seasoned hams with decades of experience to first time participants earning their very first contacts -- worked side by side, sharing knowledge and building friendships across the bands.

## Stations, Setups, and Serious Skill

This year's Field Day featured an impressive array of stations, each showcasing a different aspect of the hobby:

- **HF Voice and CW Stations** -- Operators reached across continents, logging contacts and demonstrating the power of skillful operating.
- **Digital Modes** -- FT8 and other digital stations drew crowds eager to see how modern software transforms weak signals into reliable communication.
- **Portable and Emergency Setups** -- A highlight of the event, these stations showed how quickly a team can deploy antennas, power sources, and radios in real world scenarios.
- **Youth and Newcomer Station** -- Designed to be hands on and welcoming, this area gave new operators a chance to get on the air with guidance from experienced mentors.

## Learning Through Doing

Workshops and demonstrations ran throughout the day, covering topics such as:

- Antenna building and tuning
- Emergency communications techniques
- Logging software and contesting strategies
- Radio propagation and solar cycle insights

Participants didn't just watch -- they soldered, tuned, troubleshot, and transmitted, gaining practical skills that define the ham radio experience.

## The Spirit of Amateur Radio

What truly set the 2025 event apart was the atmosphere. Laughter mixed with the rhythmic tapping of Morse code. Kids gathered around handheld radios, amazed at hearing voices from hundreds of miles away. Operators cheered as the club broke past contact milestones. Every moment reflected the core values of amateur radio: curiosity, resilience, and a willingness to help others learn.

## Powering the Airwaves

Sustainability played a bigger role this year, with several stations running on solar power, battery banks, and portable generators. These setups demonstrated how amateur radio remains a vital tool during emergencies -- capable of operating independently when traditional infrastructure fails.

## A Successful Field Day, On and Off the Air

As logs were tallied and antennas came down, the sense of accomplishment was unmistakable. The RARS team not only made an impressive number of contacts but also strengthened the bonds that make the club thrive. Field Day 2025 wasn't just a test of equipment -- it was a celebration of the people who keep the hobby alive.

## Looking Ahead

With new operators inspired, new skills learned, and new friendships formed, the RARS community is already looking forward to next year's event. If Field Day 2025 proved anything, it's that amateur radio remains as exciting, relevant, and community driven as ever.
