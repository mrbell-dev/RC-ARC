[{"categories":["Resources"],"contents":" Discord Quick Start Guide New to Discord? This quick start guide covers everything you need to know to get up and running. Discord is a free communication platform used by many amateur radio communities for text, voice, and video chat.\nWhat is Discord? Discord is a communication platform that lets you interact through text, voice, and video. It works on desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android), and in your web browser at discord.com. Think of it as a mix between group chat and a forum, but in real time.\nCreating an Account Go to discord.com or download the app from your device\u0026rsquo;s app store Click Register Enter your email, a username, and a password Verify your email address You\u0026rsquo;re in! Tip: Use your call sign as your display name (e.g., \u0026ldquo;David - N7WOY\u0026rdquo;) so other hams can recognize you.\nKey Concepts Servers A server is a private, invite-only space for a community. Think of it like a clubhouse with different rooms for different topics. You can be a member of many servers at once. They appear as round icons on the far-left sidebar.\nText Channels Marked with a # symbol Separate chat rooms for different topics (general chat, announcements, tech help, etc.) Type your message in the chat bar at the bottom and press Enter to send Messages stay in the channel history so you can scroll back and catch up You can attach images, files, and links using the + button or by dragging and dropping Voice Channels Marked with a speaker icon Just click a voice channel name to join \u0026ndash; no calling or ringing needed Others can see you\u0026rsquo;re in the channel and drop in anytime Supports voice, video, and screen sharing Click Disconnect (the phone icon) to leave Think of it like a repeater: you join a voice channel and everyone there can hear you. Unlike a repeater, multiple people can talk at once and you can share your screen too!\nNavigating Discord Area Location What It Does Server List Far left Round icons for each server you\u0026rsquo;ve joined Channel List Left panel All channels in the current server Messages Center Where conversations happen Member List Right panel Shows who\u0026rsquo;s online Your Controls Bottom left Your profile, mic, and speaker controls Sending Messages Type in the chat bar at the bottom of a text channel and press Enter @mention someone by typing @ followed by their name to notify them Reply to a specific message by hovering over it and clicking the reply arrow React to any message by hovering over it and clicking the smiley face Upload files with the + button or drag and drop directly into the chat Messages can be up to 2,000 characters Voice Chat Controls When you join a voice channel, your controls appear at the bottom left:\nMicrophone icon \u0026ndash; Mute/unmute yourself Headphone icon \u0026ndash; Deafen (mute all incoming audio) Camera icon \u0026ndash; Turn video on/off Screen icon \u0026ndash; Share your screen or a specific window Phone icon \u0026ndash; Disconnect from voice Direct Messages (DMs) Click on someone\u0026rsquo;s name, then Message to start a private conversation DMs appear under the Discord logo / Home button at the top of your sidebar You can create group DMs with up to 10 people Voice and video calls work in DMs too Managing Notifications Discord can get noisy. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to keep it manageable:\nRight-click a server icon and choose notification settings: All Messages, Only @mentions, or Nothing Right-click a channel to mute it individually Recommended: Set servers to \u0026ldquo;Only @mentions\u0026rdquo; to avoid notification overload Set your status to Do Not Disturb to silence all notifications temporarily Mark as Read: Right-click a server icon to clear all unread indicators Status Indicators Green \u0026ndash; Online Yellow \u0026ndash; Idle / Away Red \u0026ndash; Do Not Disturb Gray \u0026ndash; Offline or Invisible Set your status by clicking your avatar in the bottom-left corner.\nText Formatting Discord supports markdown formatting in messages:\nFormat How to Type It Result Bold **text** text Italic *text* text Underline __text__ text Strikethrough ~~text~~ text Inline Code `code` code Quote \u0026gt; text (indented quote) Keyboard Shortcuts Shortcut What It Does Ctrl + K Quick channel/DM switcher Ctrl + F Search current channel Ctrl + Shift + M Mute/unmute microphone Ctrl + Shift + D Deafen/undeafen audio Ctrl + E Open emoji picker Ctrl + / Show all keyboard shortcuts Esc Mark channel as read Up Arrow Edit your last message On Mac, replace Ctrl with Cmd.\nRoles Roles are labels assigned to members by server administrators. They control what you can see and do in a server. Role names often appear as colored usernames. Some channels may only be visible to members with certain roles.\nGood Discord Etiquette Post in the right channel for the topic Use @everyone and @here sparingly Be respectful \u0026ndash; same as on the air Read pinned messages when you join a new channel for rules and important info Mute your mic in voice channels when you\u0026rsquo;re not talking Use threads for long side conversations to keep channels clean Finding Ham Radio Communities Many amateur radio clubs and groups have Discord servers.

What began as a technical exercise quickly transformed into a vibrant celebration of teamwork, innovation, and the enduring magic of radio waves.\nA Gathering Built Around Connection Field Day has always been about more than equipment and antennas. In 2025, the RARS community emphasized the deeper purpose of amateur radio: connecting people. Operators of all ages \u0026ndash; from seasoned hams with decades of experience to first time participants earning their very first contacts \u0026ndash; worked side by side, sharing knowledge and building friendships across the bands.\nStations, Setups, and Serious Skill This year\u0026rsquo;s Field Day featured an impressive array of stations, each showcasing a different aspect of the hobby:\nHF Voice and CW Stations \u0026ndash; Operators reached across continents, logging contacts and demonstrating the power of skillful operating. Digital Modes \u0026ndash; FT8 and other digital stations drew crowds eager to see how modern software transforms weak signals into reliable communication. Portable and Emergency Setups \u0026ndash; A highlight of the event, these stations showed how quickly a team can deploy antennas, power sources, and radios in real world scenarios. Youth and Newcomer Station \u0026ndash; Designed to be hands on and welcoming, this area gave new operators a chance to get on the air with guidance from experienced mentors. Learning Through Doing Workshops and demonstrations ran throughout the day, covering topics such as:\nAntenna building and tuning Emergency communications techniques Logging software and contesting strategies Radio propagation and solar cycle insights Participants didn\u0026rsquo;t just watch \u0026ndash; they soldered, tuned, troubleshot, and transmitted, gaining practical skills that define the ham radio experience.\nThe Spirit of Amateur Radio What truly set the 2025 event apart was the atmosphere. Laughter mixed with the rhythmic tapping of Morse code. Kids gathered around handheld radios, amazed at hearing voices from hundreds of miles away. Operators cheered as the club broke past contact milestones. Every moment reflected the core values of amateur radio: curiosity, resilience, and a willingness to help others learn.\nPowering the Airwaves Sustainability played a bigger role this year, with several stations running on solar power, battery banks, and portable generators. These setups demonstrated how amateur radio remains a vital tool during emergencies \u0026ndash; capable of operating independently when traditional infrastructure fails.\nA Successful Field Day, On and Off the Air As logs were tallied and antennas came down, the sense of accomplishment was unmistakable. The RARS team not only made an impressive number of contacts but also strengthened the bonds that make the club thrive. Field Day 2025 wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a test of equipment \u0026ndash; it was a celebration of the people who keep the hobby alive.\nLooking Ahead With new operators inspired, new skills learned, and new friendships formed, the RARS community is already looking forward to next year\u0026rsquo;s event. If Field Day 2025 proved anything, it\u0026rsquo;s that amateur radio remains as exciting, relevant, and community driven as ever.\n","permalink":"https://www.rowanars.net/events/field-day/","tags":["field-day","events","event-general"],"title":"Field Day"},{"categories":["Resources"],"contents":" Helpful Links A collection of useful resources for amateur radio operators, from our club pages to licensing information, equipment retailers, and more.\nRARS Resources RARS on ARRL - Our club listing on the ARRL website N4UH Broadcastify Feed - Listen to the N4UH repeater online Licensing \u0026amp; Testing Study Resources HamStudy.org - Free online study materials and practice exams ARRL Exam Session Search - Find a license exam near you ARRL Getting Licensed - Official guide to getting your ham license License Lookup FCC License Search (ULS) - Look up any amateur radio license in the FCC database Nearby VE Testing Sessions Mecklenburg ARS (Charlotte) - Charlotte area testing Richmond County ARC - Rockingham area testing Five County Ham Radio Enthusiasts - Raleigh/Fuquay-Varina area Equipment Retailers Major Online Retailers Ham Radio Outlet (HRO) - World\u0026rsquo;s largest ham radio supplier with stores nationwide DX Engineering - Quality equipment, antennas, and accessories GigaParts - Amateur radio, computers, and electronics Used Equipment QRZ Swapmeet - Buy/sell used ham radio equipment eHam Classifieds - Used equipment listings Organizations ARRL - American Radio Relay League (National Association for Amateur Radio) ARES - Amateur Radio Emergency Service SKYWARN - NWS severe weather spotter program Technical Resources QRZ.com - Callsign lookup and ham radio community RepeaterBook - Repeater directory for North America APRS.fi - APRS tracking and mapping PSK Reporter - Digital mode propagation reporting DX Summit - DX cluster spots GMRS (FCC) - General Mobile Radio Service information NCMesh - North Carolina mesh networking community Propagation \u0026amp; Conditions NOAA Space Weather - Solar and geomagnetic conditions HF Propagation - HF propagation prediction DX Heat Map - Real-time DX activity Discord Communities OARC - Online Amateur Radio Community - Large online ham radio community HHRC - Ham Radio Crash Course - Ham Radio Crash Course Discord server The HamShack - General ham radio discussion server Find more ham radio Discord servers at Disboard.\nHave a link suggestion?
