### TODO List

- Need to change the icon for the website to a little ham radio
- need to make the form submit do some html work to make sure we have a valid email address
- Add a link to license fcc lookup page on the links page
- Create documentation on how the website is organized. 
- I think we want to remove things from post if they are not posts and if they are general information static pieces. For example the field day page is informational but the firecracker hamfest page is date based. 
- I also think we need to have instead of index.en.md in all of these it needs to be better named. We might have multiple things inside of the firecracker-hamfest folder because it happens yearly. 
- Broadcastify does not have the 400 mhz repeater. We can remove that from the pages for broadcast. The repeater still works but it is not on broadcastify. 
- I would also like to add a quick reference page for local repeaters that we can touch near the club HQ. We can get this info from repeaterbook. 
- We need documentation that is extremely granular for people who have not used github/git/go/hugo to be able to have people in the future update the repository and create new posts. 
-- We want this to be in github wiki format. 
- Add digital membership form.
