### TODO List

#### Deferred Items (Future Update)

- I think we want to remove things from post if they are not posts and if they are general information static pieces. For example the field day page is informational but the firecracker hamfest page is date based.
- I also think we need to have instead of index.en.md in all of these it needs to be better named. We might have multiple things inside of the firecracker-hamfest folder because it happens yearly.
- Set up Obsidian Sync to manage all files in this repository. This would allow editing content on the fly and adding new posts directly from Obsidian.
